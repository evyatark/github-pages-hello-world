# Python scripts - web scraping

These scripts perform web scraping, using BeautifulSoup python library.

The sites scraped are sites with tutorials for direct watch, without an option to download. The scripts create a (Unix) shell file that downloads all videos.

WARNING: This is only to exercise web scraping. Entering these sites is dangerous. I take no responsibility for anything you do with these sites and these scripts.

If you like any tutorial, buy it from the official source!

The bs.py script demonstrates web scraping of haaretz.co.il site (bypassing the paywall...)
